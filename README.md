## Dapper

I have created a Generic Repository based in Dapper, approaching its philosophy to Entity Framework, removing the string queries far as possible, primarily for delete, update, insert and for All methods queries.

I tried to create a custom library with comfort of Entity Framework and with performance of Dapper.
I have tested DPGenericRepository with Sql Server and Oracle, but it must compatible with all databases Dapper supported.
